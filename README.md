# Recipes

![CI](https://github.com/carlogico/Recipes/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=feature%2Fbuild-gh-pages)

To build with sphinx, `cd` to the `docs` folder and `make html` or `make latexpdf`.

For a quick overview, go to the [introduction](docs/source/Recipes/Introduction/Introduction.rst),
or look at it in all of its *Read the Docs* glory [here](https://carlos-recipes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

Also a built version is [here](https://carlogico.github.io/Recipes/index.html), built
[using GitHub Actions](.github/Workflows/main.yml) and hosted by GitHub Pages.
