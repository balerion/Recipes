Lilikoi (Passion Fruit) Cheesecake Tart
========================================

.. ingredients::

   For the crust:

   - 195 g all-purpose flour
   - 50 g powdered sugar
   - pinch of salt
   - 130 g cold butter, cut into pieces
   - 1 egg

   For the cheesecake filling:

   - 2 eggs
   - 250 g cream cheese
   - 1/4 cup sugar
   - juice of 1 medium lemon
   - zest of that lemon

   For the topping:

   - 1/2 cup lilikoi juice
   - 50 g butter, melted
   - ~1/3 cup sugar
   - 1 egg, whisked
   - cornstarch (possibly around 1.5-2 Tbsp?)

.. procedure::

   Put the flour, sugar, and salt in a food processor and pulse briefly.
   Add the butter and pulse until the pieces of butter are around the size of oatmeal and peas.
   Mix the egg on its own and slowly add it to the food processor, pulsing as you go.
   Do a few more ~10-second-long pulses until the dough comes together (the food processor will start making a different noise right before this happens).
   Briefly knead the dough to work in any extra dry ingredients.
   Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for a couple of hours.
   Roll out the chilled dough to a circle around 12 inches in diameter.
   Put in a buttered tart pan (or a springform cake pan works too).
   Poke holes in the dough with a fork.
   Freeze the crust for 30 minutes (so you don't need to put weights on it).
   Put a buttered sheet of aluminum foil on top of the dough.
   Bake the crust in an oven preheated at 375 degrees Fahrenheit for ~20 minutes.
   Remove the crust from the oven, remove the foil, and turn down the oven to around 340 degrees Fahrenheit.
   Combine the filling ingredients in a bowl and mix until smooth.
   Pour into partially cooled tart shell and bake ~15 minutes, until the filling has set.
   For the topping, mix the sugar with a little cornstarch in a bowl on the side.  Melt the butter in a saucepan and add in the sugar/cornstarch and lilikoi juice over low heat.
   As soon as the sugar has dissolved (while the mixture isn't too hot yet), add the egg.
   Continuously mix until boiling.
   Remove from heat and let cool.
   Pour the topping over the cheesecake layer after both have cooled.
   Refrigerate together before serving.

.. note::

   The lilikoi topping was amazing, and it worked well with the rest, but I think both the cheesecake layer and tart crust could be improved.
   I would be curious to try a graham cracker crust at one point.  I also think the tart shell would have been better if I hadn't followed the instructions and folded it in on itself at the edge (it was too thick).
   I used lilikoi juice instead of pulp, so I needed to add extra cornstarch to the topping since it didn't thicken enough on it's own.  I'm not sure exactly how much I added since I did it after the fact (mixed in with a little of the topping to avoid clumps), but maybe it would be ok with around 1 Tbsp?  It tasted great and ended up being the consistency I wanted, so I think using juice works well.
   The biggest mistake I made was that I added the egg when the lilikoi mixture was too hot, so a little bit of the egg scrambled and I had to remove it.  Avoid that in the future.
   I was happy with the combination of cheesecake tart and lilikoi sauce, but I'm not sure how happy I would have been with the cheesecake part on its own.  I might try something like a more traditional cheesecake next time.
   I've now made the lilikoi curd again, and it actually goes quite well with raspberry too.  I still want to experiment more with making a raspberry/lilikoi cake.
