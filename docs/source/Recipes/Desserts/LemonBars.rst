Cassie's Lemon Bars
===================

.. ingredients::

   - 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
   - 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
   - 1 cup butter, softened
   - 4 eggs
   - 1 1/2 cups white sugar
   - 1/2 cup lemon juice
   - 1 tablespoon lemon zest


Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix 2 cups of flour and confectioner's sugar together. Cut in the butter or margarine.
Mix well until the dough resembles pie dough consistency. Press the dough into a 9x13 inch baking pan.
Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown.
Beat together eggs, sugar, 4 tablespoons flour, lemon juice and lemon rind for at least 1 minute. Pour the mixture over the baked crust.
Bake the bars another 20 minutes, or until the lemon topping has set. Sprinkle with confectioner's sugar when cooled.

Note: I double the filling so its more filling to crust. The recipe as is results in about half crust, half filling.
