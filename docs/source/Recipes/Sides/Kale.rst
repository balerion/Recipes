Soy Sauce Kale
==============


-  *a bunch of kale*
-  *garlic (n cloves, lightly smashed)*
-  *1 tbsp soy sauce*
-  *juice from 1/8th of a lemon*



In a skillet, heat up the oil. Add the smashed garlic. Cook 2 mins until
golden. Cook 3-5 mins until wilted and slightly browned. Add soy sauce
and lemon juice. Cook until the liquids mostly evaporate and the kale is
more wilted and darker.
