Hokkaido Milk Rolls
=====================

-  *43 gr bread flour*
-  *86 gr milk*

Combine milk and flour in a skillet and cook on medium heat until it forms a gelatinous paste
(about 5 minutes).

-  *300 gr bread flour*
-  *113 gr milk*
-  *40 gr butter*
-  *1 egg*
-  *5 g instant yeast*
-  *30 gr sugar*
-  *6 g salt*

Mix everything (including the paste from the previous step) with stand mixer at medium-high speed for 5 minutes (until it forms a ball).
Make a ball, cover dough, let rise for 1-2 hours.
Deflate the dough, divide in 4 parts, shape into flat rectangles and roll them up.
Place the rolls in a loaf pan.
Let rise for 40 mins - 1 hour. Egg wash.
Cook in a 350F oven until ready (25 minutes). Add a container with water in the oven for the first 5-10 minutes.

.. note::

   in the stand mixer, before adding the butter, the dough seemed too dry.
   Add water but overshot it. Added more flour...
   I think the recipe can take a bit more liquid (maybe 5-10 gr?)
