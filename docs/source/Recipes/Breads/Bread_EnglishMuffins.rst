English Muffins
=====================

-  *540 g bread flour*
-  *400 g lukewarm milk*
-  *43 g butter*
-  *1 egg*
-  *6 g instant yeast*
-  *25 g sugar*
-  *9 g salt*

Mix everything with stand mixer at medium-high speed for 5 minutes (until it forms a ball).
Make a ball, cover dough, let rise for 1-2 hours.
Coat cast iron pan with oil, sprinkle with cornmeal or similar.
Deflate the dough, divide in 16 parts, shape into balls and place them on the pan.
Let rise for 20 mins.
Cook until ready. If burning, move into a 350 F oven.

.. note::

   Halved the recipe, but not the egg... Dough was extremely wet.
   The proofing made the dough ball bigger than expected.
